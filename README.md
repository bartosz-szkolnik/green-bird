Very simple Twitter (I wonder when we will stop calling it that) clone build with Supabase and Next.js 13. Saved as a reference to future projects. 

Credits go to [Jon Meyers](https://egghead.io/q/resources-by-jon-meyers) and his course [Build a Twitter Clone with the Next.js App Router and Supabase](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-twitter-clone-with-the-next-js-app-router-and-supabase-19bebadb).
